# Multiple-Github-accounts

Sometimes we need to work with multiple github accounts in one machine. We canâ€™t simply
copy the https url and clone it. We might need an SSH method. For that we have to setup some
configuration in the machine and in Github.

## 1. Generate an SSH-key

## 2. Follow the prompts and decide a name, e.g. github_office.
```
ssh-keygen -t "name for the file" -C "github email"
eg:
ssh-keygen -t "github_office" -C "abc@gmail.com"
```

## 3. Open the pub file using
```
cd .ssh/
cat github_office.pub
```

## 4. Copy the SSH public-key to GitHub from ~/.ssh/.pub and 
## create an SSH key

## 5. Create a config file in ~/.ssh with the following contents:
```
Host github-calib-office (name should be similar to git)
HostName github.com
User git
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_office
```

## 6. After Adding an SSH key clone the repo using ssh link modify it with the host name.
```
git clone git@github-calib-office:username/repo.git
```
